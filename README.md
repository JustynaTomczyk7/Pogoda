## General info

This project is a weather application that reads our location and downloads the weather for this location.

To play the location I used the Geolocation API, and to read the weather I used the OpenWeather API. Thanks to this API I got the current weather and forecast for the next 4 days.

The aim of this project was to gain practical skills in writing in JavaScript and using the API.
